<h1>Terrain Painter</h1>

<big>Have you ever wanted more control over your procedurally generated terrains in TC2? Then this extension is for you!</big> <br>
<br>
<div style="color:var(--selectCol)">
	This is an extension for <a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/65563">Terrain Composer 2</a>, a terrain generation tool developed by Nathaniel Doldersum, and only works with it!
</div> <br>

<h4> What is TC2 Painter? </h4>
TC2 Painter allows you to paint TC2 nodes directly in the editor, greatly improving your terrain creation workflow, both procedual and painted. <br>
It helps procedural terrain creators wanting more control over their terrain aswell as terrain painters laying out there terrain manually by offering more options on what to paint.
Using this tool you can paint everything, from simple heights and splats over stone fields and forests to whole biomes with little setup required thanks to TC2's simple node editor interface. <br>
<br>

<h4> How TC2 Painter will improve your procedural terrain generation workflow: </h4>
<ul>
	<li> No need to switch between image editor and TC2 anymore </li>
	<li> You don't have to rely on noise to get your positioning right </li>
	<li> Extend your normal brush capabilities to conditional painting </li>
	<li> Save/Load any image and edit it with an advanced toolset right inside Unity </li>
</ul>

<h4> Prefer manual painting over procedural generation? This is why TC2 Painter is still perfect for you: </h4>
<ul>

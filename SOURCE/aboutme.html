<h1>About Me</h1>
My name is Seneral, aka <a href="https://forum.unity3d.com/members/seneral.638015/" target="_blank">Seneral</a>, and I am a german student at the age of 16. <br>
I'm also a passionate Unity developer and especially love programming it's editor. <br>
My greatest fascination about developmenet is (interactive) procedural/parametric modeling of levels, characters and terrain. <br>
<br>
My hobby began with 3D-modeling in Blender, which I put to practice for the <a href="http://tesrenewal.com/">TESRenewal: Skywind</a> project in 2014. 
Shortly using the Blender Game Engine, I started developing with Unity in 2013 and quickly focused on editor tools. <br>
I published my first project in March 2015 which has now become the popular opensource <a href="https://github.com/Baste-RainGames/Node_Editor">Node Editor Framework</a>.
My other projects range from <a href="https://gist.github.com/Seneral" target="_blank">small IMGUI hacks</a> over character and mesh generation tools 
to a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/a8f49zwjbry2h10/AAA6NQ6zJXrDLx3l88pK57N9a?dl=0" target="_blank">GPU Erosion Simulation</a> 
and <a href="TerrainPainter/index.html">TC2 Painter</a>. <br>
<br>
Next to programming, I also do athletics and live my fascination for copters in building my own DIY quadcopter.

<h1>About Me</h1>
My name is Seneral, aka Seneral, and I am a german student at the age of 16. <br>
I'm also a passionate Unity developer and especially love programming it's editor. <br>
My greatest fascination about developmenet is (interactive) procedural/parametric modeling. <br>
<br>

<h4>Alt1</h4>
My hobby began with 3D-modeling in Blender, which I put to practice for the <a href="http://tesrenewal.com/">TESRenewal: Skywind</a> project in 2014. <br>
Over the Blender Game Engine I started developing in Unity in 2013 and quickly focused on editor tools. <br>
I published my first project in March 2015 which has now become the popular opensource <a href="https://github.com/Baste-RainGames/Node_Editor">Node Editor Framework</a>. <br>
My projects range from small IMGUI hacks over character and mesh generation tools to a GPU Erosion Simulation and TC2 Painter. <br>

I first started exploring the world of game developement over 4 years ago, starting with 3D-modeling in Blender. <br>
I then somehow quickly found my way over the Blender Game Engine to Unity, where I now develop for about 3years. <br>
I'm a proud member of the Unity community and love contributing and interacting with it. <br>
<br>
I spend alot of time developing on my open-source Node Editor Framework which I first published in March 2015. <br>
At that time it was rough, I barely started programming the editor, but it has been a constant source of new skills and passions over the course of the last year. <br>
<br>
I developed interest in modular and procedural ways to develop levels, characters and terrain, which led into a lot of interesting projects I've not quite ready to show yet. <br>
The first row of terrain tools, accompanying Terrain Composer 2, are on the way to be released though, like <a href="TerrainPainter/index.html">TC2 Node Painter</a> and <a href="ErosionSimulation/index.html">Advanced GPU Erosion Simulation</a>. <br>

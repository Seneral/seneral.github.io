<h2> An index of my Unity projects </h2>
Although not complete, here are some of the Unity projects I've published over the years. <br>
Be aware that I am not an active Unity developer anymore, and support for existing projects is very limited. <br>
Some smaller utilities can be found on my <a href="https://gist.github.com/Seneral">gist</a>. 
<br>
<br>
<h2>TC2 Node Painter - A Terrain Composer 2 extension</h2>
TC2 Node Painter allows you to paint TC2 nodes directly in the editor, greatly improving your terrain creation workflow, both procedual and painted. <br>
It helps procedural terrain creators wanting more control over their terrain aswell as terrain painters laying out there terrain manually by offering more options on what to paint.
Using this tool you can paint everything, from simple heights and splats over stone fields and forests to whole biomes with little setup required thanks to TC2's simple node editor interface. <br>

<br>
<br>
<h2>Terrain Simulation Suite</h2>
This unreleased tool is a GPU-powered shallow water simulation used to simulate processes like thermal/hydraulic erosion on terrains right inside Unity. <br>
It was intended to have both a filter (immediate) as well as interactive capabilities in order to directly shape your terrain. <br>
Internally the simulation works on 4 different terrain material layers, which allows for complex and realistic terrain simulations. <br>
It hasn't been worked on in years, however I am happy to send it out to anyone interested. <br>

<br>
<br>
<h2>Open Source Node Editor Framework</h2>
A project started by me in March 2015 that aims to provide a fully-featured, open source framework for node-based displays and routines. <br>
Through ongoing developement over the past years and many contributors it has now become very flexible and easy to extend. <br>
Working both in the editor and at runtime, it is one of the few editors suitable for runtime applications. <br>
Some unique features have been developed to power the GUI such as the GUI scale hack <a href="https://gist.github.com/Seneral/2c8e7dfe712b9f53c60f80722fbce5bd" target="_blank">GUIScaleUtility</a>. <br>

<br>
<br>
<h2>UndoPro - Action-based Undo Integration for the Unity Editor</h2>
A utility for developers to provide undo actions even in challenging situations where the default Undo system is lacking.
It integrates right into the Unity undo system and thus requires no further workflow adjustments by the users of your system. <br>

<h1>About</h1>
My name is Seneral, and I am a german student. I spend a lot of time working on various projects! <br>
Most of what I do now is related to computer vision and electronics, though in the past I mainly did Unity Editor development and sometimes Web Development. <br>
Here are some of the areas I worked on:

<h4>3D-Modeling</h4>
My hobby began with 3D-modeling in Blender, which I put to practice for the <a href="http://tesrenewal.com/" target="_blank">TESRenewal: Skywind</a> project in 2014. 
Shortly using the Blender Game Engine, I soon switched to Unity in 2013. <br>

<h4>Unity Editor Dev</h4>
Please refer to <a href="unity.html">this page</a> for an index on my unity editor tools.

<h4>Web Dev</h4>
Out of frustration with YouTube and in need for a proper music platform, I built <a href="https://github.com/Seneral/FlagPlayer">FlagPlayer</a>, a single-page client-side web app frontend for YouTube, in late 2019. <br>

<h4>DIY Electronics</h4>
In 2016 I started designing and building a 500mm Quadcopter from the ground up (3D Prints, carbon cutting and all). Now in its second version, I had planned to use it as a testbed for various future computer vision and robotics projects. <br>
In the beginning of 2019 I developed a <a href="https://github.com/Seneral/SerialHMD">DIY VR headset</a> based on a Raspberry Pi Zero, including a OpenVR driver to interact with SteamVR. It barely worked, and needed much more work to tune the filter. It is no longer worked on in its current version. <br>

<h4>Optical Tracking</h4>
At the end of 2019 I started working on what would later become the beginnings of the AsterTrack optical tracking system. <br>
Combining many areas of expertise that I had little experience in, this was the largest single undertaking so far. <br>
There is a <a href="astertrack.html">WIP page</a> as well as a very early <a href="https://github.com/Seneral/MakersVR">code project</a>.

<h3>Languages</h3>
C++ > C# > C > Javascript > python<br>
